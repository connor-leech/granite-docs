## Overview

We introduce the Granite series of decoder-only code models for code generative
tasks (e.g., fixing bugs, explaining code, documenting code), trained with code
written in 116 programming languages. A comprehensive evaluation of the Granite
Code model family on diverse tasks demonstrates that our models consistently
reach state-of-the-art performance among available open source code LLMs.

The key advantages of Granite Code models include:

- All-rounder Code LLM: Granite Code models achieve competitive performance on
  different kinds of code-related tasks, including code generation, explanation,
  fixing, editing, translation, and more. Demonstrating their ability to solve
  diverse coding tasks.
- Trustworthy Enterprise-Grade LLM: All our models are trained in a transparent
  manner, and according to
  [IBM’s AI Ethics principles](https://www.ibm.com/impact/ai-ethics). We release
  all our Granite Code models under an
  [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) for research
  and commercial use.

Granite Code models come in two main variants:

- Granite Code base models: base foundational models designed for code-related
  tasks (e.g., code repair, code explanation, code synthesis).
- Granite Code instruct models: instruction following models fine-tuned using a
  combination of Git commits paired with human instructions and open source
  synthetically generated code instruction datasets.

Both base and instruct models are available in sizes of 3B, 8B, 20B, and 34B
parameters.

For more information see the Technical
[IBM GitHub Granite Code models page](https://github.com/ibm-granite/granite-code-models?tab=readme-ov-file#introduction-to-granite-code-models),
the
[Granite Code models collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/ibm-granite/granite-code-models-6624c5cec322e4c148c8b330)
on Hugging Face, and the [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04324).

### Data for Granite Code

In the spirit of open innovation,
[data-prep-kit](https://github.com/IBM/data-prep-kit), the framework and
pipelines used for preparing the training data for Granite Code models are being
open-sourced with Apache 2.0 license. The framework offers data transformation
pipelines that can readily scale from laptop-scale to data-center scale for ease
of iterative experimentation as well as large-scale production.

## Prompts for code

Here, we share sample prompts to get started. Please expect these templates and
best practices to be updated as needed.

We recommend using Granite code models with the following prompt template -
without a system prompt:

```
Question:
{PROMPT}

Answer:
```

Note that there are two newlines between the end of the prompt and a newline
after the Answer.

You can try with and without and use what works best. Unlike language models,
the code model system prompt can be further adapted and customized for a given
use case.

### Basic example

```markdown
Question:
Write a code to find the maximum value in a list of numbers.

Answer:
```

Expected output of the basic example:

````markdown
```python
def find_max(numbers):
    max_value = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers:
        if num > max_value:
            max_value = num
    return max_value
```<|endoftext|>
````

Example with system prompt - please note that the system prompt is optional:

```markdown
System:
"You are an intelligent AI programming assistant, utilizing a Granite code language model developed by IBM. Your primary function is to assist users in programming tasks, including code generation, code explanation, code fixing, generating unit tests, generating documentation, application modernization, vulnerability detection, function calling, code translation, and all sorts of other software engineering tasks."

Question:
{PROMPT}

Answer:
```

### Code generation

As Granite code models are useful in a variety of software development
scenarios, we show you some of the most typical in this section.

Python function example:

```markdown
Question:
Write a python function to find the first repeated character in a given string.

Answer:
```

Expected response from model for python function example:

````markdown
To find the first repeated character in a given string, we can use a dictionary to store the frequency of each character in the string. We can iterate through the string and for each character, we can check if it's already in the dictionary. If it is, we can return the character as the first repeated character. If it's not, we can add it to the dictionary with a frequency of 1.

```python
def first_repeated_character(string):
    char_freq = {}
    for char in string:
        if char in char_freq:
            return char
        else:
            char_freq[char] = 1
    return None
```<|endoftext|>
````

Python Code to test response from model:

```python
def first_repeated_character(string):
        char_freq = {}
        for char in string:
                if char in char_freq:
                        return char
                else:
                        char_freq[char] = 1
        return None


input_string = "hello world"
result = first_repeated_character(input_string)
print(f"The first repeated character in '{input_string}' is: {result}")
```

### Code explanation

Example that requests the explanation of a code function in Python:

```python
Please explain the following Python function:

def find_max(numbers):
    max_value = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers:
        if num > max_value:
            max_value = numxs
    return max_value


Answer:
```

Expected response from model:

```
The function `find_max` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the maximum value in the list. It initializes the `max_value` variable to the first element of the list. Then, it iterates over each element in the list using a for loop. For each element, it checks if it is greater than the current `max_value`. If it is, the `max_value` is updated to the new maximum value. Finally, the function returns the maximum value
```

### Code fixing

Example that asks the model to identify a bug in a line of Python code. The
prompt also asks the model to return a function that fixes this bug:

```
Question:
Please, identify the bug in this code snippet: “””print(“Hello World.)””” and recommend an updated function that fixes the bug.

Answer:
```

Expected response from model:

```
The bug in the code snippet is that the closing quotation mark is missing after the word "World". To fix this bug, you can update the function as follows:

def print_hello_world():
    print("Hello World.")

By adding the missing closing quotation mark, the bug is resolved, and the function will correctly print "Hello World."<|endoftext|>
```

### Code translation

Example that asks the model to translate a function from Python to Java.

```python
Question:
Please translate a Python method that finds the maximum value in a list of numbers to Java:
def find_max(numbers):
    max_value = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers:
        if num > max_value:
            max_value = numxs
    return max_value

Answer:
```

Expected response from model:

```
Here's the Java equivalent of the Python method:

public static int findMax(int[] numbers) {
    int maxValue = numbers[0];
    for (int num : numbers) {
        if (num > maxValue) {
            maxValue = num;
        }
    }
    return maxValue;
}

In this Java method, we declare an integer variable called maxValue and initialize it with the first element of the numbers array. Then, we iterate over each element in the numbers array
```

### Math reasoning

Example to solve a math reasoning problem.

```
Question:
Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?

Answer:
```

Expected response from model:

```
Natalia sold 48 clips in April.
In May, she sold half as many clips as in April, so she sold 48/2 = 24 clips.
Altogether, Natalia sold 48 + 24 = 72 clips in April and May.
#### 72
The answer is: 72<|endoftext|>
```

### Function calling

Example that asks the model to choose a function that solves a task. Note that
the first part of the question is a custom system prompt.

```
Question:
You are an expert in composing functions. You are given a question and a set of possible functions.
Based on the question, you will need to make one or more function/tool calls to achieve the purpose.
If none of the function can be used, point it out. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out. You should only return the function call in tools call sections.

Here is a list of functions in JSON format that you can invoke:

{'name': 'get_current_weather', 'description': 'Get the current weather', 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'location': {'type':'string', 'description': 'The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA'}},'required': ['location']}}
{'name': 'get_stock_price', 'description': 'Retrieves the current stock price for a given ticker symbol. The ticker symbol must be a valid symbol for a publicly traded company on a major US stock exchange like NYSE or NASDAQ. The tool will return the latest trade price in USD. It should be used when the user asks about the current or most recent price of a specific stock. It will not provide any other information about the stock or company.', 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'ticker': {'type':'string', 'description': 'The stock ticker symbol, e.g. AAPL for Apple Inc.'}},'required': ['ticker']}}
Should you decide to return the function call(s), put it in the format of [func1(params_name=params_value, params_name2=params_value2...), func2(params)]

NO other text MUST be included.
Question: What's the current weather in New York?
Answer:
```

Expected response from model:

```
[get_current_weather(location="New York")]<|endoftext|>
```

### Code completion

Example that asks the model to complete an assert statement. A function for that
assert statement is also provided as part of the prompt:

```
Question:
Based on the given Python code, which may contain errors, complete the assert statement with the output when executing the code on the given test case. Do NOT output any extra information, even if the function is incorrect or incomplete. Output "# done" after the assertion.

def f(a, b):
    for key, value in b.items():
        if key not in a:
            a[key] = [value]
        else:
            a[key].append(value)
    return a

assert f({}, {'foo': 'bar'}) ==

Answer:
```

Expected response from model:

```
{'foo': ['bar']}
# done<|endoftext|>
```

## Avoiding common issues

- Granite Code models were not designed for language tasks and are not
  appropriate for such use. Any such use is at your own risk, and you may not
  rely on resulting output. Please validate all output independently and
  consider deploying a Hate Abuse Profanity (HAP) filter. See
  [this notebook](https://github.com/ibm-granite-community/granite-code-cookbook/blob/main/recipes/Guard-Rails/HAP.ipynb)
  for reference.
- **Increase max output tokens for longer code responses**: It is important to
  increase the Max output tokens to ensure the model does not cut off the code
  response, resulting in incomplete code.
- **Greedy mode for precise output**: Use Greedy mode for precise results.
- **Be careful about whitespaces and line breaks**: Make sure that the prompt
  templates are correctly implemented, and that there are no unintended
  white-spaces, and that there is exactly one line-break at the end of the
  prompt.
- **Use existing tags**: The model is trained very explicitly to handle the
  special tags of “System:”, “Question:”, and “Answer:”.
- **System Prompt isn't required for code models**: Try out the\
  `Question:{PROMPT} Answer:` format without a system prompt first. If you don't\
  get the desired results, you can try the system prompt as described in the\
  [code examples](#prompts-for-code) section. You can also try experimenting\
  with other instructions, but first start with the basic `Question: Answer:`\
  format.
